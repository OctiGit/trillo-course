# Trillo Project

Landing page of a travel sales company.

The language learned in this course's project was CSS and SASS.

This project was built by me, based on the online course Advanced CSS and SASS by professor Jonas Schmedtmann, who designed it and allowed me to use it for my personal learning and portfolio.
